  description: "My name is Marcos Hernández. I am a professional and enthusiastic programmer, constantly learning and improving on my own. I am very interested in discovering new technologies and solving problems, even if I don't always succeed. I work with different web development stacks, but I strive to make the web more accessible, though it can be challenging. My main skill is in JavaScript, and I try to use it for everything, even if it's not always the best choice. I am available for any job opportunity that fits my skills and interests, even if I may not be the best at everything.",
